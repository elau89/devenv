Eric's custom Docker development environment

USAGE
===============
Only two manual steps are needed for setup:
- Create a file named gituser.txt and set it with your user name and email to
  append to your .gitconfig file
- Copy your .ssh folder into your .dockervol directory and make sure both your
  .dockervol and .ssh directories are set to chmod 700
